# About
 This is a script meant to be used as an interactive layer for the `oathtool`.

# Description
 This script allows one to manage multiple 2FA tokens similar to what `Google Authenticator` does,
but using the bash command line.

The real goal here is to have this script replacing the default shell command of a Unix/Linux user, 
so that it can be used as an interactive terminal tool to manage 2FA on a local/remote server.
